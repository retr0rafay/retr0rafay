# Hello Devs!
I am a Software Engineer at Salesforce who loves to code 💻 , travel 🛫, game 🎮,, read 📖 , and play ping pong 🏓. I graduated with my Bachelor's in CS from Georgia State
University and received my Master's in CS from Georgia Tech. What I love about tech is how it's constantly evolving, and that means that I get to constantly learn and get better as a Software Engineer.
